        <h4>Career Goals:</h4>
        <p>
          I have a ton of career goals I want to achieve, both in the programming industry and IT industry
          I would love to work with others on a team developing a massive project.
          The process of building a project with others is one of the most fulfilling events to participate in.
          This could involve working on a webapp, desktop application, or potentially even
          someday video game development. I also want to work within the networking industry someday,
          whether that would be replacing / installing networking technology or maintaining a
          server.
